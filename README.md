## Prerequisites

You need Node.js and npm installed on your computer. This project was built against the following versions:

## Get started

`cd` into the project directory
`npm install`
`npm start`

If the videos do not load, you may need to turn off CORS through a Google Extension to get the videos to load. I used the Google extension, Moesif CORS.
